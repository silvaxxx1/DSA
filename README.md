# DSA in C & Python

This repository contains implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **C** and **Python**, as well as **Machine Learning algorithms**, with parallelization support using **CUDA** and **Triton** for optimized performance.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Graph Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementations of basic ML algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- **Parallelization**:
  - **CUDA**: GPU acceleration for performance optimization in C implementations.
  - **Triton**: High-performance custom kernels in Python for machine learning and algorithm computations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler** (e.g., GCC)
- **Python 3.x** with necessary libraries (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- **CUDA**: Make sure you have the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit installed for GPU support.
- **Triton**: Install Triton by following the instructions in the [Triton GitHub](https://github.com/OpenAI/triton).
